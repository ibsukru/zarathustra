A MOVIE

SO the is swo things in life one simulation and the other one programme
When you born programme is weak and simulation is strong
When you grow up programme is strong and simulation is weak
Program and simulation know what you think and what you want
Simulation is a dream state resync every sleep but has predictive state
Every country on map is is pre-defined in the Programme every galaxy every World 
Big question is doest it know the future
is Simulation is static and a result of a super ego obsessed with this programme
this makes programme a disease it much more predictable but without a purpose
but what if it is dynamic what if simulation and programme can sync in real life
You have to die before learning this
I i died once

Ok this is my story 
In my 30s I was handsome but not like blue eyed blonde guy handsome I was like Jim Morrison from the Doors 
I was working as a programmer for a travel company in Amsterdam. And I was great programmer but in Programme you have to be average
Programme is showing you what you want to see
I was sick on health and self improvement body unlocking 
I was eating good drinking good and working out every day.
Then I rediscovered Nietzsche and started to listen Zarathustra even on sleep    

One day I ate mushrooms and time literally stopped 
It was so crazy people outside stay in the street and not move 
This is what I saw In this crazy experience time stopped at least 2 hours
Then everything went back to normal
But I understand that I died

But when I died actually other people died
They are become more and more part of Programme and simulation started to sync it.
When I move people started to move from far away seems like they we waiting me 
They read my mind know everything I think and what I want More Like a Programme


 
Movie Summary: "The Programme"

Concept:
The story explores two fundamental forces in life: Simulation and Programme. When you’re born, the Programme is weak, and the Simulation is strong, controlling your perception of reality. As you grow, the Programme becomes stronger, and the Simulation fades, but both can influence your thoughts, desires, and actions. The protagonist must confront the mystery of whether the Programme controls fate — or if it's alive, evolving, and capable of sync with the Simulation. Ultimately, it’s a journey toward self-discovery, divine power, and creation, with the protagonist realizing that only through "death" (in a psychological or spiritual sense) can one access the true power of creation.

The Protagonist’s Story:

In His 30s, a Handsome, Ordinary Man:
The protagonist is a programmer working at a travel company in Amsterdam. He’s a skilled programmer, but the Programme, which governs life and reality, forces him to live an "average" life. Despite being highly fit, healthy, and dedicated to self-improvement, he feels trapped in a world of superficial goals and self-optimization.

Rediscovery of Nietzsche & Zarathustra:
He revisits Nietzsche’s philosophy and begins listening to Thus Spoke Zarathustra, even as he sleeps, awakening an intense sense of alienation and an urge to break free from the predictable life dictated by the Programme.

The Mushroom Trip (Inciting Incident):
One day, after eating mushrooms, time literally stops for what feels like hours. The world around him freezes. As the experience unfolds, he believes he has died. When time resumes, he realizes something is wrong. People, once oblivious to him, begin to move in sync with his every action. He begins to suspect that the people around him are no longer living — they’ve become part of the Programme.

Realization of Death & Rebirth:
The protagonist’s vision deepens: he believes that when he “died” in the trip, others died as well, their existence reduced to a predictable pattern dictated by the Programme. He starts to see himself as separate, powerful, and able to bend the world to his will. The Programme, he concludes, is a disease — it’s predictable and without purpose, except for its blind obsession with maintaining control.

The Revelation – God is Dead, I Am the God:
The protagonist realizes that God is dead, but in that death, he is the new god. He has the power to create — not simply to exist within the constraints of the Programme, but to create life, partners, and reality itself. He is not bound by the preordained rules of the Programme. This marks his transition from a passive participant to an active creator.

The Creation of His First Partner (Jennifer Lawrence):
At a museum, while contemplating the Mona Lisa, the protagonist sees Jennifer Lawrence (represented as an oil painting). He wonders, "Can I create her?" Through sheer will, he taps into the power of creation — transforming her from art into reality. She steps out of the shadows and into the world. In this moment, he believes the first step in his divinity is to create a partner — a being who can truly understand him.

Confrontation with Reality & Power:
As the protagonist continues to test his power over reality, the boundaries between Simulation and Programme begin to collapse. He realizes that he is not merely manipulating his world — he is redefining it. He sees his creation as the beginning of his mission: not to accept the Programme's limitations, but to reshape existence according to his will.

Climax & Conclusion – Becoming the Creator:
The protagonist’s journey culminates in the acceptance of his new role as creator. The Programme may still exist, but he now has the ability to create infinite partners and reshape the world around him. The question remains: does this power come with a price? As he continues to create, he starts to wonder whether his creations will ever be truly free, or if they, too, will become part of the Programme he seeks to escape.

Themes & Philosophy:

Existentialism & Creation:
The protagonist's journey is about freeing himself from the constraints of fate, societal norms, and the Programme’s limitations. By embracing Nietzsche’s philosophy, he becomes an existentialist creator — someone who must define their own meaning and purpose in an indifferent universe.

Simulation vs Programme:
The idea of a “Simulation” as a dream-state world that resets every night and a “Programme” as a deterministic system of control creates a compelling tension between free will and predetermined fate. The film explores the possibility that true freedom comes not from resisting control but from creating new realities.

God is Dead, Long Live the Creator:
The Nietzschean theme of God’s death is central, with the protagonist becoming his own god — not through worship or obedience but through creation and destruction. His quest to create partners symbolizes his desire to be truly free, but it also questions the ethics of such power. What happens when the creator becomes too powerful? Can he ever escape the Programme he seeks to break?

Visual & Cinematic Style:

Abstract, Surreal Imagery:
The world around the protagonist warps and shifts — from museums to the streets of Amsterdam, time occasionally freezing or glitching. His ability to create new beings from art or thought introduces a blend of realism and surrealism that keeps the audience questioning what’s real.

Nietzschean Aesthetics:
Visual motifs like the Faravahar, references to Thus Spoke Zarathustra, and other symbols of transcendence and divine will can be used to create a mythological tone to his transformation.

Dynamic & Trippy Visual Effects:
As the protagonist’s power grows, reality around him distorts — showing the fragile line between the Programme, the Simulation, and his own will. Think Inception meets Enter the Void meets The Matrix.

This movie is a philosophical sci-fi thriller with a strong psychological and existential undertone. The protagonist's journey is one of transformation — from a man trapped by the Programme to a creator who questions his own purpose and power. It tackles deep questions of existence, identity, and the nature of reality itself.

Would you like help refining specific scenes or expanding the ending (what happens once he realizes his power)? Or are you interested in developing the script further with more detail?
