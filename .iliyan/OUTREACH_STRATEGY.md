## Outreach Templates

### Cold Email Template (Director/Actor)
```
Subject: Zarathustra: The Programme - Philosophical Sci-Fi Short

Hi [Name],

I'm reaching out about a 20-minute philosophical sci-fi short I've written and WGA-registered: *Zarathustra: The Programme*.

Logline: A programmer in Amsterdam maxes out his dopamine through supplements and Nietzsche, triggering a psychedelic ego death where time stops and he becomes god—until the Programme sends cops disguised as his creation to bring him back.

Think *Enter the Void* meets *The Matrix* set in Amsterdam. It's about dopamine capitalism, ego death, and the cost of waking up.

[For Directors]: Your work on [specific film] showed you understand [psychedelic visuals/philosophical themes/etc.]. This project needs someone who can execute frozen Amsterdam sequences while keeping the Nietzschean philosophy grounded.

[For Actors]: The lead role is 90% screen time—Jim Morrison energy, early 30s, magnetic but dangerous. It's a showcase piece with long silent sequences and philosophical voiceover.

Would you be open to reading the script? I can send the full screenplay + visual references.

Best,
Ibrahim Velinov

### Producer Template
```
Subject: Seeking Producer - Zarathustra: The Programme (WGA Reg. 2321535)

Hi [Name],

I'm seeking a producer for *Zarathustra: The Programme*, a 20-25 min philosophical sci-fi short set in Amsterdam.

**Why this project:**
- Complete WGA-registered script
- Festival-ready concept (Sundance, SXSW, Rotterdam targets)
- Timely themes (attention economy, dopamine capitalism)
- Strong visual identity (frozen Amsterdam, glitch aesthetics)
- Budget-scalable (€10K-€250K depending on approach)

**Comps:** *Enter the Void*, *Pi*, *American Psycho*

[Name of company] has a track record with [specific films], which suggests you understand philosophical/arthouse projects that can travel internationally.

Would you be interested in reading the script and discussing co-production possibilities?

Attached: Logline document + script available on request

Best,
Ibrahim Velinov

## Rejection Tracker

| Company/Person | Date | Response | Follow-up |
|----------------|------|----------|-----------|
| Lemming Film (Matthijs van der Veer) | Nov 2025 | Not working with Ena, passed | - |
| | | | |

**Learnings:**
- Lemming mentioned "Ena" - unclear who this is, but suggests they thought this was related to another project
- May need clearer positioning in initial outreach

---

## Notes

- **Language advantage:** Protagonist's multilingual background is key to story - consider this in casting
- **Amsterdam-specific:** Location is character - need local production knowledge
- **Philosophy-first:** Don't pitch as "just" a psychedelic film - the Nietzsche is the hook
- **Budget flexibility:** Can shoot guerrilla (€10K) or professional (€250K) - have both plans ready
