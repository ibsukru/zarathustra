# Character Breakdown

## THE MAN (Protagonist)

**Age:** Early 30s  
**Appearance:** Dark hair, unkempt in an intentional way. Leather jacket, faded band tees. Jim Morrison energy—feral, magnetic, dangerous in a way you can't name.  
**Nationality:** Not Dutch (speaks Dutch fluently but it's learned—this is crucial to the story)  
**Occupation:** Programmer at a travel company in Amsterdam

### Personality
- **Obsessive optimizer**: Tracks everything—sleep, macros, supplements, code commits
- **Philosophically hungry**: Rediscovered Nietzsche and can't stop consuming *Thus Spoke Zarathustra*
- **Quietly magnetic**: People notice him without him trying
- **Isolated by awareness**: Sees patterns others don't, which makes connection difficult
- **Controlled burn**: Keeps his intensity contained until the mushroom trip

### Arc
- **Part 1**: Trapped in the Programme, sensing the cage but unable to name it
- **Part 2**: Preparing to burn—maxing dopamine, obsessing over Nietzsche, feeling the shift
- **Part 3**: Ego death—becomes god, sees the architecture, realizes he died
- **Part 4**: Sovereign but hunted—refuses to go back, walks the edge between creation and isolation

### Key Traits
- **Speaks multiple languages** (native tongue + Dutch + English)—this is his advantage over the Programme
- **Physically fit** but not vain—the gym is optimization, not vanity
- **Handsome** but not in a conventional way—more dangerous than pretty
- **Technically brilliant** but sees code as a cage, not freedom

### Casting Notes
- Needs to carry the film almost entirely through presence and voiceover
- Must be comfortable with long silent sequences (frozen Amsterdam, ego death)
- Should have intensity that reads as both attractive and unsettling
- Ideally someone who understands philosophy or has lived through psychedelic experiences

**Casting Comps:**
- Young Jim Morrison (The Doors)
- Oscar Isaac (*Ex Machina*, *Inside Llewyn Davis*)
- Rami Malek (*Mr. Robot*)
- Riz Ahmed (*Sound of Metal*)

## THE WOMAN / OFFICER DE VRIES (Antagonist/Creation)

**Age:** Mid-20s  
**Appearance:** Blonde, luminous, timeless beauty. Could be from the 17th century or yesterday.  
**Role:** Amsterdam Police Officer (or is she?)

### Function in Story
She exists in three states:
1. **The Painting**: "Portrait of an Unknown Woman, c. 1650" in the Rijksmuseum
2. **The Desire**: The protagonist's attempt to create a partner, an equal
3. **The Trap**: The Programme's response—she appears as a cop to delegitimize his creation

### Key Question
Is she:
- His creation who gained autonomy and chose to become a cop?
- The Programme's creation, designed to look like his desire?
- Both—a real creation who was immediately co-opted by the system?

The film never answers this. The ambiguity is the point.

### Casting Notes
- Must feel both ethereal (painting-like) and grounded (cop authority)
- Needs to shift between warmth and menace in a single scene
- Should have a face that could belong in a Dutch Golden Age painting

## SUPPORTING CHARACTERS

### The Coworker
**Role:** Friendly Dutch colleague at the travel company  
**Function:** Represents normal Programme compliance—nice, optimized, unaware  
**Key Scene:** Asks "You always listening to music?" (doesn't understand the Man is listening to Nietzsche)

### The Gym Attendant
**Role:** Front desk guy at the gym  
**Function:** Programme NPC—scripted friendliness, optimized customer service  
**Key Scene:** "Good session today, yeah?" (the Man doesn't respond)

### The Five People (Gym)
**Roles:** Woman in yoga pants, man in suit, teenager with basketball, older man with glasses, young woman with headphones  
**Function:** First visible sync—all glance at the Man at the same beat  
**Visual:** Should feel like a glitch in the Matrix

### The Street Group (Part 4)
**Roles:** 5-6 people blocking the sidewalk  
**Function:** Programme using people to test if he'll claim godhood  
**Key Line:** "You look lost." (the Man refuses to engage)

### The Two Cops (Museum)
**Roles:** Officers accompanying the Woman  
**Function:** Backup threat—if he resists, they're authorized to escalate  
**Visual:** Should feel like agents from *The Matrix*—too perfect, too synchronized

## VOICEOVER / AUDIOBOOK NARRATOR

**Role:** The voice of *Thus Spoke Zarathustra* audiobook  
**Function:** Philosophical anchor, the Man's internal guide  
**Tone:** Deep, measured, authoritative but not cold  
**Key Lines:**
- "I teach you the Overman. Man is something that shall be overcome."
- "You must be ready to burn yourself in your own flame."
- "One must still have chaos within oneself to give birth to a dancing star."

**Casting Note:** Could be the Man's own voice (recorded separately) or a distinct narrator. If distinct, should sound like a philosopher-prophet, not a commercial audiobook reader.

## THE CITY (Character)

Amsterdam itself is a character:
- **Canals**: Mirrors, reflections, distortions
- **Bikes**: Flow, rhythm, the Programme's choreography
- **Museums**: Repositories of frozen time (paintings as static Simulation)
- **Trams**: Predictable, on rails, Programme infrastructure
- **Streets**: Where the sync happens—people moving in patterns

The city should feel:
- Beautiful but cold
- Organized but oppressive
- Alive but scripted

## CASTING PRIORITIES

1. **The Man**: 90% of screen time—must carry the film
2. **The Woman/Cop**: Crucial final beat—must land the ambiguity
3. **Everyone else**: Can be non-actors if they have the right presence (the sync is more important than performance)

**Diversity Note:** The Man's non-Dutch background is essential to the story (language as Programme blind spot). The Woman should match the painting's aesthetic (17th-century Dutch Golden Age = likely blonde/pale, but this can be reinterpreted if the painting is changed to an original work).
