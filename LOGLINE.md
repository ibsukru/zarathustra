- "Time stopped. He didn't."
- "God is dead. He took the job."
- "Dopamine is currency. He was the richest man in Amsterdam."

## Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)

"Imagine *The Matrix* meets *Enter the Void* set in Amsterdam. A programmer obsessed with Nietzsche and self-optimization floods his system with dopamine until he triggers a psychedelic ego death. Time literally stops for two hours. When it resumes, he realizes he's become god—but the system that controls reality starts using people around him to bring him back. It's a philosophical thriller about dopamine capitalism, ego death, and the cost of waking up."

## Festival Programmer Pitch (1 minute)

"*Zarathustra: The Programme* is a 20-minute philosophical sci-fi short that asks: what if the attention economy isn't just exploiting you—it's farming you? Our protagonist is a programmer in Amsterdam who maxes out his dopamine through supplements, weed, and Nietzsche. He becomes the highest-value node in the city's attention economy. When he eats mushrooms, time stops, and he experiences ego death—seeing the architecture of reality: the Programme (deterministic control) and the Simulation (dream-state) collapsing into one. He thinks he's escaped. But when time resumes, people move in sync with him, anticipating his thoughts. He wasn't chosen to escape—he was chosen to be harvested. The film is visually stunning (frozen Amsterdam, glitch aesthetics, Nietzschean iconography) and philosophically dense (dopamine as currency, language as cage, God as evil architect). Think *American Psycho* but instead of Wall Street violence, it's Amsterdam ego death. It's personal, political, and deeply cinematic."
