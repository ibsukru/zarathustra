FADE IN:

EXT. RIJKSMUSEUM - COURTYARD - DAY

Amsterdam light — clean, cold, perfect. The museum rises like a cathedral of culture. Tourists cluster at the entrance, phones out, selfie sticks extended.

A BIKE LOCK clicks open. Hands — strong, deliberate — secure a black city bike to the rack.

The MAN straightens. Early 30s. Dark hair, unkempt in a way that looks intentional. Leather jacket over a faded band tee. Jim Morrison energy — feral, magnetic, dangerous in a way you can't name.

He moves through the crowd. People glance. A WOMAN in her 50s pauses mid-sentence, watches him pass. A TEENAGER with headphones turns. The Man doesn't acknowledge them. Or maybe he's so used to it, it's invisible.

INT. RIJKSMUSEUM - ENTRANCE HALL - CONTINUOUS

High ceilings. Light pours through glass. The Man badges in with a membership card — the kind that says he's been here before, many times.

He walks with purpose but no hurry. Past the gift shop. Past the information desk. Into the galleries.

INT. RIJKSMUSEUM - GALLERY OF HONOR - DAY

Rembrandt. Vermeer. The Night Watch looms in the distance. Tourists bottleneck there, phones raised like offerings.

The Man turns left, into a quieter wing.

INT. RIJKSMUSEUM - SMALLER GALLERY - DAY

Fewer people here. Older paintings. Lesser known. The air feels thicker, like the room is holding its breath.

He stops.

An OIL PORTRAIT hangs on the wall, modest frame, no velvet rope. A WOMAN — mid-20s, blonde, luminous. She wears something timeless, maybe 17th century, maybe yesterday. Her eyes are the kind that follow you, but not in the cheap haunted-house way. In the way that makes you wonder if she's deciding whether you're worth her time.

The placard reads: "Portrait of an Unknown Woman, c. 1650, Artist Unknown."

The Man steps closer. His reflection ghosts over the canvas in the frame glass.

                         MAN (V.O.)
           Two forces run the world.

He tilts his head. Studies the brushstrokes — the way light catches her cheekbone, the faint smile that might be pity or invitation.

                         MAN (V.O.)
           The Simulation. And the Programme.

Behind him, a TOUR GROUP shuffles past. A GUIDE drones about Golden Age techniques. The Man doesn't turn.

                         MAN (V.O.)
           When you're born, the Programme is weak.
           The Simulation is strong. Every night it resets,
           feeds you dreams, shows you worlds.

He leans in until his breath almost fogs the glass.

                         MAN (V.O.)
           As you grow, the Programme hardens. It draws the maps.
           Writes the scripts. Makes you average.

The gallery lights flicker — just once, barely perceptible. Or maybe it's his pulse syncing with the hum of the fluorescents.

The Woman in the painting seems to shift — a microscopic tilt of her gaze, like she's looking at him now instead of through him.

He freezes.

                         MAN (whisper, barely audible)
           Can I create you?

Silence. Then—

A CHILD laughs somewhere in the next room. The spell breaks.

The Man exhales, steps back. His hands are trembling. He shoves them in his pockets.

A COUPLE walks past behind him — mid-30s, holding hands, speaking Dutch in low tones. As they pass, both turn their heads toward him at the exact same moment, same angle, same duration. Then they look away and keep walking.

He watches them go, jaw tight.

                         MAN (V.O.)
           Or maybe I'm seeing things.

He turns back to the portrait one last time. The Woman stares back, unchanging.

He leaves.

EXT. RIJKSMUSEUM - STEPS - DAY

The Man descends the wide stone steps. Unlocks his bike. Throws a leg over.

A TRAM glides past, silent except for the hum of electric rails. Every passenger in the window is looking at their phone. Same posture. Same angle.

He pedals away.

EXT. AMSTERDAM STREETS - DAY

The city flows around him. Canals. Bridges. Narrow brick buildings leaning like old men. He rides with headphones in, but we don't hear the music yet — just the city breathing.

Traffic lights flip green ahead of him in sequence, one after another, like dominoes falling in his favor.

He doesn't notice. Or he's pretending not to.

INT. GYM - ENTRANCE - DAY

A modern box of glass and steel. Minimalist. The Man swipes his membership card, nods at the FRONT DESK ATTENDANT — a guy in his 20s with a clipboard and a smile that's been optimized for customer retention.

                         ATTENDANT
           Good session today, yeah?

The Man doesn't answer. He's already moving toward the locker room.

INT. GYM - LOCKER ROOM - DAY

He changes quickly. Tank top. Shorts. Beats headphones. He catches his reflection in the mirror — lean, defined, the body of someone who's been at war with entropy for years.

He looks away.

INT. GYM - ROWING AREA - DAY

A row of Concept2 ergs. Most are empty. The Man takes the one in the corner, facing the wall.

He straps his feet in. Adjusts the damper. Grips the handle.

The monitor blinks to life: READY.

He pulls.

The first stroke is smooth. The second is faster. By the tenth, he's found the rhythm — a metronome weaponized.

The monitor counts: 500m split, watts, strokes per minute. Numbers climb.

1:28… 1:26… 1:24…

His face is stone. Sweat beads on his forehead, drips.

1:23… 1:22.5…

The monitor flickers. Just for a frame. The split drops to 1:21.8 — a number that would put him in the top percentile, close to world-class.

Then—

BEEP.

The number snaps back to 1:25.0 and locks there, no matter how hard he pulls.

A small message flashes at the bottom of the screen: LIMIT REACHED.

He keeps rowing. Harder. The handle bends in his grip. His breath saws. The number doesn't move.

1:25.0.

1:25.0.

1:25.0.

He stops. Lets the handle fly forward. Chest heaving. Sweat drips onto the rail.

                         MAN (V.O.)
           The Programme shows you more than you can do.
           Then reminds you what you're allowed.

He sits there, staring at the monitor like it lied to him.

Behind him, FIVE PEOPLE walk past in a slow, staggered line:

1. A WOMAN in yoga pants, towel over her shoulder.
2. A MAN in a business suit, gym bag in hand.
3. A TEENAGER with a basketball.
4. An OLDER MAN, grey beard, reading glasses.
5. A YOUNG WOMAN, headphones on, eyes down.

As each one passes, they glance at him — same beat, same angle, same duration. Like a conductor cued them.

None of them speak. They flow past like a tide he summoned.

The Man watches them go. His jaw tightens.

                         MAN (V.O.)
           Another day inside the Programme.

He stands. Unstraps his feet. Grabs his towel and water bottle.

As he walks toward the locker room, the gym feels wrong for a heartbeat — like the air forgot what to do, like the fluorescent hum skipped a note — then normal resumes.

He doesn't look back.

FADE TO BLACK.
