# PART 2

INT. MAN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Small. Clean. Minimalist in a way that feels intentional, not empty. A single bookshelf: philosophy, code manuals, a few novels. A laptop on a low table. No TV.

The Man sits on the floor, back against the couch. Headphones on. Eyes closed.

A BOOK lies open on his lap: "Thus Spoke Zarathustra" by Friedrich Nietzsche. Dog-eared. Highlighted. Margin notes in tight handwriting.

But he's not reading. He's listening.

                         AUDIOBOOK NARRATOR (V.O., filtered through headphones)
           "I teach you the Overman. Man is something that shall be overcome.
           What have you done to overcome him?"

The Man's lips move slightly, syncing with the words. He knows them by heart.

                         MAN (V.O.)
           I rediscovered Nietzsche three months ago.
           Or maybe he found me.

He opens his eyes. Stares at the ceiling.

                         MAN (V.O.)
           At first, I read. Then I listened.
           Now I can't stop.

INT. MAN'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

The Man lies in bed. Dark room. City light bleeds through the curtains.

Headphones still on. Eyes closed. The audiobook plays.

                         AUDIOBOOK NARRATOR (V.O.)
           "You must be ready to burn yourself in your own flame:
           how could you become new, if you had not first become ashes?"

His breathing slows. He's drifting.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. MAN'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - MORNING

Alarm buzzes. The Man wakes. Headphones tangled around his neck. The audiobook is still playing—hours later, a different chapter.

                         AUDIOBOOK NARRATOR (V.O.)
           "And life itself confided this secret to me:
           'Behold,' it said, 'I am that which must always overcome itself.'"

He sits up, rubs his face. Looks at his phone: 6:47 AM.

He rewinds the audiobook to the beginning. Again.

INT. OFFICE - OPEN PLAN - DAY

The Man at his desk. Headphones on. Code on one monitor. Slack on the other.

His fingers type fast, precise. But his eyes are distant.

                         AUDIOBOOK NARRATOR (V.O., faint)
           "Man is a rope, tied between beast and Overman—
           a rope over an abyss."

A COWORKER—mid-30s, friendly, Dutch accent—leans over the partition.

                         COWORKER
           Hey, you coming to the standup?

The Man doesn't hear. The Coworker waves a hand.

                         COWORKER
           Hello?

The Man pulls one earcup back.

                         MAN
           Yeah. Two minutes.

                         COWORKER
           You always listening to music?

                         MAN
           Something like that.

The Coworker smiles, confused, and walks away.

The Man puts the headphone back. Returns to the code.

EXT. AMSTERDAM STREETS - EVENING

The Man bikes home. Headphones on. The city glows in twilight.

                         AUDIOBOOK NARRATOR (V.O.)
           "The higher we soar, the smaller we appear
           to those who cannot fly."

He weaves through traffic. A PEDESTRIAN steps into the bike lane without looking. The Man swerves, misses by inches.

The Pedestrian doesn't flinch. Doesn't even turn.

The Man looks back. The Pedestrian walks on, same pace, same posture.

                         MAN (V.O.)
           Patterns. Everywhere.

INT. GYM - ROWING AREA - NIGHT

The Man rows. Headphones on. The audiobook plays under the rhythm of the erg.

                         AUDIOBOOK NARRATOR (V.O.)
           "You must have chaos within you
           to give birth to a dancing star."

His strokes sync with the words. Breath. Pull. Recover. Repeat.

The monitor flickers. 1:24… 1:23… BEEP. 1:25.0. LIMIT REACHED.

He doesn't stop. He rows through it, eyes closed, lips moving.

                         MAN (whisper, syncing with audiobook)
           "...chaos within you..."

INT. MAN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

The Man sits on the floor again. Headphones on. The book open.

He's reading along with the audiobook now, finger tracing the lines.

                         AUDIOBOOK NARRATOR (V.O.)
           "And once you have said 'Yes' to one joy,
           you have said 'Yes' to all woe as well."

He stops. Rewinds. Listens again.

                         AUDIOBOOK NARRATOR (V.O.)
           "And once you have said 'Yes' to one joy,
           you have said 'Yes' to all woe as well."

He closes the book. Stares at the cover.

                         MAN (V.O.)
           I listen to it every day. At work. At the gym.
           At night, while I sleep.

INT. MAN'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT (MONTAGE)

A series of nights:

- The Man lies in bed. Headphones on. Eyes closed. The audiobook plays.
- He shifts. Mumbles in his sleep. The words bleed into his dreams.
- He wakes at 3 AM. The audiobook is still playing. He doesn't turn it off.
- Morning. He wakes. Rewinds. Starts again.

                         MAN (V.O.)
           I don't know if I'm learning it or if it's learning me.

INT. OFFICE - OPEN PLAN - DAY

The Man at his desk. A MEETING notification pops up: "Q3 Roadmap Review."

He dismisses it. Opens a private note file. Types:

"Can I create you?"

He stares at the line. Deletes it. Types again:

"What have you done to overcome him?"

He closes the file.

INT. MAN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

The Man sits cross-legged on the floor. Headphones on. Eyes closed.

The audiobook plays, but now he's not just listening—he's somewhere else.

                         AUDIOBOOK NARRATOR (V.O.)
           "I am a wanderer and a mountain climber," said he to his heart.
           "I do not love the plains, and it seems I cannot sit still for long."

The room feels smaller. The walls closer. The air thicker.

He opens his eyes. Looks at his hands. They're trembling.

                         MAN (V.O.)
           Something is changing.

He looks at the bookshelf. At the window. At the ceiling.

                         MAN (V.O.)
           Or maybe I'm just seeing it now.

INT. MAN'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - MORNING

The Man stands at the counter. A row of bottles lined up like soldiers:

- Mucuna Pruriens (L-Dopa precursor)
- Ashwagandha
- Rhodiola
- A grinder with weed
- Espresso machine hissing

He takes the mucuna. Two capsules. Swallows with water.

Ashwagandha. One capsule.

Rhodiola. One capsule.

He grinds weed. Rolls a joint. Lights it. Inhales.

                         MAN (V.O.)
           I optimized everything.
           Sleep. Food. Supplements. Training.

He exhales smoke. Sips espresso.

                         MAN (V.O.)
           Mucuna floods dopamine.
           Weed amplifies it.
           The gym burns it into my system.

He looks at the bottles.

                         MAN (V.O.)
           I thought I was unlocking my body.

Beat.

                         MAN (V.O.)
           Maybe I was just becoming the perfect battery.

INT. MAN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY

The Man sits with his laptop. Opens Instagram. Scrolls.

An AD appears: Exactly the supplement he just took. Mucuna Pruriens.

He stops. Stares.

He closes Instagram. Opens YouTube.

A RECOMMENDED VIDEO: "Optimize Your Dopamine - Biohacking Guide"

He didn't search for it.

He closes the laptop.

                         MAN (V.O.)
           The internet knows.

He picks up his phone. A NOTIFICATION: "Your rowing session yesterday was 5% above average."

He didn't open the app.

                         MAN (V.O.)
           It's watching.

He puts the phone down. Looks at the supplements on the counter.

                         MAN (V.O.)
           I had the most dopamine in Amsterdam.
           And the Programme... noticed.

EXT. AMSTERDAM - CANAL - NIGHT

The Man walks alone. Headphones on. The city is quiet.

He stops on a bridge. Looks down at the water. His reflection stares back, distorted by ripples.

                         AUDIOBOOK NARRATOR (V.O.)
           "One must still have chaos within oneself
           to give birth to a dancing star."

He takes off the headphones. Silence.

The city hums. A tram passes in the distance. A bike bell rings.

He puts the headphones back on.

                         MAN (V.O.)
           I'm ready.

INT. MAN'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

The Man lies in bed. Headphones on. Eyes open.

                         AUDIOBOOK NARRATOR (V.O.)
           "You must be ready to burn yourself in your own flame..."

He closes his eyes.

                         MAN (V.O.)
           Tomorrow, I'll find out.

FADE TO BLACK.
