# PART 3

INT. MAN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON

Saturday. Light slants through the window. The city hums outside—distant, muffled.

The Man sits on the floor. No headphones this time. Just silence.

On the low table in front of him: a small bag of dried mushrooms. Maybe 3 grams. Maybe more.

He stares at them like they're a door he's been circling for weeks.

                         MAN (V.O.)
           You must be ready to burn yourself in your own flame.

He picks up the bag. Opens it. The smell is earthy, ancient.

He takes them out. Chews slowly. The taste is bitter, wrong.

He swallows. Drinks water. Sits back.

                         MAN (V.O.)
           How could you become new, if you had not first become ashes?

He closes his eyes. Waits.

INT. MAN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - LATER

Time passes. 20 minutes. 30.

The Man opens his eyes. The room looks the same. But the light is different—sharper, like the edges of things are too defined.

He stands. Walks to the window.

EXT. AMSTERDAM STREETS - CONTINUOUS (THROUGH WINDOW)

The street below. Bikes. Pedestrians. A tram in the distance.

Normal.

He watches.

Then—

A WOMAN on a bike slows. Stops. Mid-pedal. Frozen.

A MAN walking his dog—mid-step. The dog's paw hangs in the air.

A TRAM glides into frame and stops. Not at a station. Just stops. Mid-track.

The Man's breath catches.

He blinks. Rubs his eyes.

They don't move.

                         MAN (whisper)
           No.

He steps back from the window.

INT. MAN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The room feels smaller. The walls breathe. The air is thick, syrupy.

He looks at his hands. They're trembling. Or vibrating. Or both.

                         MAN (V.O.)
           This isn't real.

But it is.

He moves to the door.

INT. MAN'S APARTMENT - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

He opens the door. Steps into the hallway.

Silence. Complete. Not even the hum of electricity.

He walks to the stairs.

EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - STREET - CONTINUOUS

He pushes through the front door.

The world is frozen.

A CYCLIST—mid-turn, leaning into the curve, one foot off the pedal.

A CHILD—mid-laugh, mouth open, arms raised.

A COUPLE—mid-kiss, eyes closed, hands on each other's faces.

A PIGEON—mid-flight, wings spread, suspended three feet above the cobblestones.

The Man walks into the street. Turns in a slow circle.

Nothing moves. Not the trees. Not the canal water. Not the clouds.

                         MAN (V.O.)
           Time stopped.

He walks closer to the Cyclist. Reaches out. Touches the man's shoulder.

Solid. Warm. Real.

But frozen.

The Man pulls his hand back like he touched fire.

                         MAN (whisper)
           What did I do?

He looks up at the sky. The sun hangs there, unmoving. The light doesn't shift.

He checks his watch: 3:47 PM.

He waits.

Nothing changes.

EXT. AMSTERDAM STREETS - CONTINUOUS

He walks. Past frozen people. Past frozen bikes. Past frozen trams.

His footsteps echo in the silence.

He passes a CAFÉ. Inside, a BARISTA pours coffee—the stream frozen mid-air, a brown arc connecting pot to cup.

He passes a CANAL. A BOAT sits motionless on glass-still water.

He passes a PARK. CHILDREN on swings, suspended at the peak of their arc.

                         MAN (V.O.)
           How long has it been?

He checks his watch: 3:47 PM.

Still.

He keeps walking.

EXT. AMSTERDAM - MAIN SQUARE - CONTINUOUS

The square is full of people. Tourists. Street performers. Vendors.

All frozen.

A STREET MUSICIAN—guitar mid-strum, mouth open in song.

A JUGGLER—three balls in the air, hands reaching.

A PHOTOGRAPHER—camera to eye, finger on shutter.

The Man walks through them like a ghost.

He stops in the center of the square. Turns. Looks at all of them.

                         MAN (V.O.)
           I'm the only one left.

Then, quieter:

                         MAN (V.O.)
           Or I'm the only one who died.

The air shifts. Not wind. Something else.

The light changes—flickers, like a bulb about to die.

The Man's chest tightens. His breath quickens.

                         MAN (V.O.)
           I'm burning.

He falls to his knees.

The world tilts. The frozen people blur. The sky cracks—not literally, but in his vision, like reality is a screen and someone punched through it.

He sees—

FLASHES:

- The Programme: lines of code scrolling, infinite, deterministic, mapping every street, every face, every choice.
- The Simulation: dreams layered over dreams, resetting, predicting, feeding him what he wants to see.
- The Sync: both collapsing into one, a single mesh, and he's inside it, seeing the seams.

He gasps. Claws at the cobblestones.

                         MAN (V.O.)
           I died.

The flashes intensify. Faster. Brighter.

- His face in the museum, asking "Can I create you?"
- The rowing monitor: LIMIT REACHED.
- The five people glancing at the same beat.
- The couple turning their heads in sync.
- The Simulation resets every night.
- The Programme writes the script.
- But now—

NOW—

They're the same thing.

And he's outside it.

Or inside it.

Or both.

He screams—silent, raw, a sound that doesn't exist because time doesn't exist.

Then—

Silence.

He opens his eyes.

The world is still frozen.

But he's not burning anymore.

He's ash.

He stands. Slowly. His hands steady now.

He looks at the frozen crowd. At their faces. Their eyes.

                         MAN (V.O.)
           When I died, they died too.

He walks to the STREET MUSICIAN. Looks at his face. The man's eyes are open, but empty. Not dead. Just... waiting.

                         MAN (V.O.)
           They're part of the Programme now.
           All of them.

He checks his watch: 3:47 PM.

He waits.

Then—

A sound. Faint. A heartbeat.

No. Not a heartbeat.

A clock ticking.

The world SHUDDERS.

The Juggler's balls drop—one, two, three—and he catches them, continues juggling like nothing happened.

The Street Musician's hand completes the strum. The note rings out.

The Photographer's shutter clicks.

The crowd moves. Talks. Laughs.

Time resumes.

The Man stands in the center of the square, motionless.

Everyone flows around him. No one looks at him.

No.

Wait.

A WOMAN walks past. Glances at him. Same beat. Same angle.

A MAN on a bike. Glances. Same beat.

A TEENAGER with headphones. Glances. Same beat.

One after another. Like a wave. Like they're waiting for him to move so they know where to go.

The Man's jaw tightens.

                         MAN (V.O.)
           They know what I'm thinking.
           They know what I want.

He takes a step forward.

The crowd shifts. Adjusts. Makes space.

He takes another step.

They move with him. Not following. Syncing.

                         MAN (V.O.)
           The Simulation and the Programme.
           They're not fighting anymore.

He stops.

The crowd stops.

He turns.

They turn.

                         MAN (V.O.)
           They're listening.

He looks at his hands. Steady. Powerful.

                         MAN (V.O.)
           I burned.
           I became ash.
           Now I'm new.

He looks up at the sky. The sun is setting now—time is moving again, but faster, like it's catching up.

He checks his watch: 5:52 PM.

Two hours. Gone.

He starts walking. The crowd parts. Flows. Syncs.

                         MAN (V.O.)
           I died once.
           And when I came back, I wasn't alone.

He walks out of the square.

EXT. AMSTERDAM - CANAL - DAY

The Man walks along the canal. The city is moving again, but wrong. People glance at him in sync. Traffic lights flip green ahead of him.

He stops.

A YOUNG MAN walks toward him. Mid-20s. Middle Eastern. Dark hair, clean-shaven. Dressed simply—jeans, jacket.

In his hands: a GOLDEN FARAVAHAR STATUE. Baby-sized. Wings spread. Intricate, gleaming in the daylight.

The Young Man sees the Man. Smiles. Not a polite smile. A knowing smile.

They pass each other.

The Man turns. Watches him go.

The Young Man doesn't look back.

                         MAN (V.O.)
           A sign. Or a test.

The Man keeps walking.

EXT. HAARLEMMERPOORT - DAY

A historic gate. Brick arches. Old Amsterdam meeting new.

The Man crosses the street. A RED LIGHT. He doesn't stop. Walks straight through.

Cars slow. No one honks. They wait.

He reaches the center of the gate. Stands beneath the arch.

The BUILDING above him LIGHTS UP. Not sunset. Not streetlights. The entire structure glows—white, gold, electric. Like an Amsterdam Light Festival installation.

But it's daytime. And this has never been a festival site.

The Man looks up. Opens his arms. Palms up. Receiving.

                         MAN (V.O.)
           I am the creator.

To his left: a WOODEN SIGN. Weathered. Restoration notice.

Hand-painted letters: **"I DIED ONCE."**

He stares at it.

                         MAN (whisper)
           I died once.

FOOTSTEPS behind him.

A POLICE OFFICER approaches. Mid-30s. Dutch. Calm but firm.

                         OFFICER
           Sir, you crossed a red light.

The Man doesn't turn. Still looking at the sign.

                         OFFICER
           Sir?

The Man slowly lowers his arms. Turns.

                         MAN
           I know.

The Officer studies him. Something is off.

                         OFFICER
           ID, please.

The Man reaches into his pocket. Hands over his ID. The Officer checks it.

                         OFFICER
           You live nearby?

                         MAN
           Jordaan.

The Officer looks up at the building. At the lights.

                         OFFICER (confused)
           What's with the lights?

The Man follows his gaze. The building is still glowing.

                         MAN
           You see them too?

The Officer frowns.

                         OFFICER
           Of course I see them. Is this some kind of installation?

The Man smiles. Quiet. Dangerous.

                         MAN
           Something like that.

The Officer hands back the ID.

                         OFFICER
           Don't cross red lights. Understood?

The Man nods. Takes the ID.

The Officer walks away. Glances back once. The Man is still standing there, arms open again, looking up.

The Officer shakes his head. Keeps walking.

The Man closes his eyes.

                         MAN (V.O.)
           The Programme can see what I create.
           But it doesn't understand.

He opens his eyes. The lights are still there.

He lowers his arms. Walks on.

The city breathes with him.

FADE TO BLACK.
