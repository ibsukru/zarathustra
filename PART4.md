INT. MAN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY

Three days after the trip.

The Man sits on the floor. No headphones. No music. Just silence and the hum of the city.

He stares at the TV—off, black screen reflecting his face.

                         MAN (V.O.)
           Something changed.

He picks up the remote. Turns it on.

A NEWS ANCHOR appears. Dutch. Speaking about traffic, weather, politics.

The Man watches. Not the content. The **person**.

                         MAN (V.O.)
           Before, TV was just... high definition Programme.
           Pixels. Data. Not real.

The Anchor turns slightly. Makes eye contact with the camera.

For a split second, it feels like he's looking **at** the Man. Not through the camera. **At him.**

The Man leans forward.

                         MAN (V.O.)
           Now... he's real.

The Anchor blinks. Continues speaking.

The Man's breath catches.

                         MAN (V.O.)
           When I'm fully synced, everything becomes real.
           The Programme can't hide anymore.

He turns off the TV. Sits in silence.

                         MAN (V.O.)
           I'm becoming a god.
           And they know it.

EXT. AMSTERDAM STREETS - DAY

The Man walks. No destination. Just moving.

People pass. Bikes. Trams. Normal.

But—

A WOMAN walking toward him slows. Glances. Same beat.

A MAN on a bike swerves slightly, adjusts his path to pass closer.

A TEENAGER crosses the street, cutting in front of him, forcing him to stop.

The Man watches. Jaw tight.

                         MAN (V.O.)
           They're syncing.
           Not with me. Against me.

He keeps walking.

More people. More adjustments. A JOGGER changes direction. A VENDOR turns to watch him pass.

                         MAN (V.O.)
           The Programme is using them.
           To slow me down. To stop me.

He walks faster.

INT. CAFÉ - DAY

The Man sits at a corner table. Coffee untouched.

He watches the other CUSTOMERS. A COUPLE at the window. A MAN with a laptop. A WOMAN reading a book.

None of them look at him.

But they're **positioned**. Blocking the exits. Facing him without facing him.

                         MAN (V.O.)
           If I say it out loud—"I am god"—
           they'll stop me.

He stands. Walks to the door.

The Couple shifts. The Man with the laptop closes it. The Woman with the book looks up.

All at the same time.

The Man freezes.

                         MAN (V.O.)
           They're waiting.

He sits back down.

They relax. Return to their routines.

                         MAN (V.O.)
           The Programme doesn't want me dead.
           It wants me quiet.

EXT. AMSTERDAM - CANAL - EVENING

The Man stands on a bridge. Alone.

He looks at the water. His reflection stares back.

                         MAN (V.O.)
           I speak Dutch. But I learned it.
           It's not my native language.

He closes his eyes.

                         MAN (V.O.)
           Language binds your thinking.
           Shapes what you can see, what you can say.
           The Programme uses language to keep you inside.

He opens his eyes.

                         MAN (V.O.)
           But when you think in a learned language,
           you see the gaps. The seams.
           You can step outside.

A PEDESTRIAN walks past. Glances. Same beat.

The Man doesn't flinch.

                         MAN (V.O.)
           They can't read my native thoughts.
           Only the ones I translate into Dutch.
           That's why they're always one step behind.

He smiles. Small. Dangerous.

INT. MAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

The Man sits at his laptop. Opens a private document. Types in his native language—**not Dutch, not English**. His mother tongue.

The words flow. Fast. Unfiltered.

                         MAN (V.O.)
           In my language, I can think freely.
           The Programme can't parse it.
           It's a blind spot.

He types:
**"I am the creator. I will prove it."**

He stops. Stares at the screen.

                         MAN (V.O.)
           If I say it in Dutch, they'll come.
           If I keep it here, I'm safe.

He closes the laptop.

INT. MAN'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

The Man lies in bed. Eyes open.

                         MAN (V.O.)
           The Programme syncs first with TV, internet, AI.
           Then people. Then reality.
           It's trying to falsify me.
           To make me doubt.

He turns his head. Looks at the window.

Outside, a FIGURE stands on the street. Looking up. At his window.

The Man sits up.

The Figure doesn't move.

The Man gets out of bed. Walks to the window.

The Figure is gone.

                         MAN (V.O.)
           They're testing me.

He closes the curtain.

EXT. AMSTERDAM STREETS - NIGHT

The Man walks home from the gym. Headphones off. Alert.

A GROUP of PEOPLE ahead. Five, maybe six. Blocking the sidewalk.

He slows.

They don't move. Don't talk. Just stand there.

                         MAN (V.O.)
           If I try to pass, they'll stop me.
           If I turn back, they'll follow.

He stops. Ten feet away.

One of them—a TALL MAN—turns. Looks at him.

                         TALL MAN
           You okay?

The Man doesn't answer.

                         TALL MAN
           You look lost.

                         MAN
           I'm not.

The Tall Man smiles. Not friendly. Knowing.

                         TALL MAN
           You sure?

The Man's fists clench.

                         MAN (V.O.)
           If I say "I am god," they'll kill me.
           Or try to.
           The Programme will use them.

He steps to the side. Walks around the group.

They don't follow. But they watch. All of them. Same angle. Same duration.

The Man keeps walking. Doesn't look back.

                         MAN (V.O.)
           I'm not ready to die again.
           Not yet.

INT. MAN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

The Man sits on the floor. The TV is on. Muted.

A TALK SHOW. The HOST laughs. The GUEST laughs. The AUDIENCE laughs.

But the Man isn't watching the show.

He's watching the **people**.

                         MAN (V.O.)
           Before, they were Programme.
           Now they're real.
           Because I'm real.

The Host turns. Looks at the camera. At **him**.

The Man's breath stops.

The Host's smile fades. Just for a frame. Then returns.

                         MAN (V.O.)
           He knows I'm watching.

The Man turns off the TV.

Sits in the dark.

                         MAN (V.O.)
           The Programme is trying to keep me inside.
           But I'm already outside.
           I just have to prove it.

He stands. Walks to the bookshelf. Pulls out the Zarathustra book.

Opens to a marked page:

**"One must still have chaos within oneself to give birth to a dancing star."**

He closes the book.

                         MAN (V.O.)
           I'll create her.
           The woman from the painting.
           And if the Programme sends cops,
           I'll know it's real.

EXT. RIJKSMUSEUM - DAY

The Man stands at the entrance. Stares at the building.

                         MAN (V.O.)
           This is where it started.

He walks inside.

INT. RIJKSMUSEUM - SMALLER GALLERY - DAY

The painting. "Portrait of an Unknown Woman."

The Man stands in front of it. Alone.

He stares at her face. Her eyes.

                         MAN (whisper)
           I created you once in my mind.
           Now I'll create you in reality.

He closes his eyes. Focuses. Wills her into existence.

Silence.

Then—

FOOTSTEPS behind him.

He opens his eyes. Turns.

A WOMAN stands there. Blonde. Luminous. The face from the painting.

His heart stops.

She smiles.

                         WOMAN
           Hi.

He can't speak.

She steps closer. Reaches into her jacket.

Pulls out a badge.

                         WOMAN
           I'm Officer De Vries. Amsterdam Police.
           We've had some reports about you.

The Man stares. At her. At the badge. At the painting behind him.

                         MAN (V.O.)
           I created her.

Beat.

                         MAN (V.O.)
           Or the Programme did.

She tilts her head.

                         WOMAN
           Are you okay?

He looks past her. Two more COPS stand at the gallery entrance.

                         MAN (V.O.)
           They're here to falsify it.
           To make me doubt.

He looks back at her.

                         MAN
           You're real.

                         WOMAN
           ...Yes?

He laughs. Quiet. Broken.

                         MAN
           Of course you are.

She reaches for his arm.

                         WOMAN
           Come with us. We can help.

He pulls back.

                         MAN
           No.

                         WOMAN
           Sir—

                         MAN
           I know what you are.

He steps around her. Walks toward the exit.

The two cops move to block him.

                         COP 1
           Sir, stop.

The Man stops. Looks at them.

                         MAN (V.O.)
           If I say "I am god," they'll stop me.
           Maybe kill me.
           The Programme will use them.

He looks back at the Woman. At the painting.

                         MAN
           I'm not going back.

He walks forward. The cops tense—

But he doesn't run. Doesn't fight.

He just **walks**. Steady. Calm.

They let him pass.

EXT. RIJKSMUSEUM - STEPS - DAY

The Man descends the steps. Into the courtyard.

Behind him, the Woman and the cops watch from the entrance.

He doesn't look back.

He unlocks his bike. Throws a leg over.

                         MAN (V.O.)
           The Programme will keep trying.
           It has to.
           Because if I stay outside, others might follow.

He pedals away.

EXT. AMSTERDAM - CANAL - DAY

The Man stops on a bridge. Looks at the water.

His reflection stares back.

                         MAN (V.O.)
           I burned twice.
           I'll burn again.

He reaches into his pocket. Pulls out the small bag of mushrooms. Still some left.

He looks at them. Then at the canal. Then at the city.

                         MAN (V.O.)
           Or maybe I just keep walking.

He puts the mushrooms back in his pocket.

Gets back on his bike.

Rides into the city.

The traffic lights flip green ahead of him. One by one.

People glance as he passes. Same beat. Same angle.

He doesn't stop.

                         MAN (V.O.)
           I am the creator.
           And the Programme knows it.

FADE TO BLACK.
