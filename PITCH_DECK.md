# ZARATHUSTRA: THE PROGRAMME
## Pitch Deck

**A 20-Minute Philosophical Sci-Fi Short**

Written by Iliyan Velinov  
WGA Registration: 2321535

---

## LOGLINE

A programmer in Amsterdam maxes out his dopamine through supplements and Nietzsche, triggering a psychedelic ego death where time stops and he becomes god—until the Programme sends cops disguised as his creation to bring him back.

---

## THE HOOK

**What if waking up is punished and compliance is rewarded—and that's by design?**

This is a film about:
- The attention economy farming your consciousness
- Dopamine capitalism as existential threat
- Ego death as the only escape
- The cost of becoming incompatible with reality

**Think:** *Enter the Void* meets *The Matrix* set in Amsterdam

---

## WHY THIS FILM MATTERS NOW

### The Attention Economy is Real
- Every platform optimizes for engagement (dopamine extraction)
- You're not the customer—you're the product being sold
- Short-term dopamine hits (likes, scrolls, notifications) train you for consumption, not creation
- This film exposes the mechanism

### Psychedelic Renaissance
- Mushrooms, ayahuasca, DMT are mainstream conversation
- Ego death is no longer fringe—it's therapy
- But no one's asking: **What happens when you wake up and can't go back?**

### Tech Workers Are Questioning Everything
- Optimization culture is burning people out
- "Hustle culture" is dopamine addiction rebranded
- This film speaks directly to people trapped in the Programme

---

## THE STORY (4-Part Structure)

### PART 1: THE CAGE (5 min)
**Setup:** Amsterdam. A handsome programmer lives an optimized life—gym, code, supplements, Nietzsche on repeat. He visits a museum, stares at a 17th-century painting of a woman, whispers: *"Can I create you?"* At the gym, five people glance at him in perfect sync. He's trapped in the Programme.

**Visual:** Clean Amsterdam minimalism. Routine as cage. Subtle glitches (lights flicker, people sync).

---

### PART 2: THE KINDLING (5 min)
**Rising Action:** He maxes out dopamine—mucuna, weed, relentless training. Listens to *Thus Spoke Zarathustra* 24/7, even in sleep. The internet syncs first: ads, notifications targeting him. He realizes: *"I had the most dopamine in Amsterdam. The Programme noticed."*

**Visual:** Neural pathways lighting up. Screens glowing. Nietzschean iconography (fire, ash, Faravahar).

---

### PART 3: THE FIRE (7 min)
**Climax:** He eats mushrooms. Time stops for 2 hours. Streets freeze. People become statues. He walks through motionless Amsterdam, realizing he's died—and so has everyone else. In the ego death, he sees the architecture: Programme (deterministic) and Simulation (random) collapse into one. He's outside both. He's the creator. When time resumes, people move in sync with him. He wasn't chosen to escape—he was chosen to be harvested.

**Visual:** Frozen Amsterdam. Pigeons mid-flight. Glitch aesthetics. POV camera work (*Enter the Void* style).

---

### PART 4: THE PROGRAMME STRIKES BACK (5 min)
**Resolution:** Days later, the TV becomes real—anchors look at him through the screen, telling him to give up. People sync against him on the streets, blocking his path. He realizes his native language is the Programme's blind spot—it can't parse his untranslated thoughts. He returns to the museum, wills the woman from the painting into existence. She appears—but as a cop, sent to bring him back. He refuses: *"This is my only life. I'm not spending it asking permission."* He walks away, keeps creating in secret, knowing the Programme will never stop hunting him.

**Visual:** Grid of TV faces. Street choreography. Museum confrontation. Final shot: alone on a bridge at dusk, smiling, sovereign.

---

## CORE PHILOSOPHY

### 1. Dopamine as Currency
The entire digital economy runs on dopamine extraction. Every click, like, scroll is a transaction. If you max out dopamine (like the protagonist), you become too valuable to ignore. The system will try to keep you inside—or bring you back.

### 2. Programme vs Simulation
- **Programme:** Deterministic operating system. Enforces averages, routines, social scripts.
- **Simulation:** Dream-state layer. Random, chaotic, resets nightly.
- **The Sync:** When they align while you're awake = creation state. You can author reality. But there's a cost.

### 3. Language as Cage
Language binds your thinking. The Programme uses it to keep you inside. But if you think in a learned language (not your native tongue), you see the gaps. **The protagonist's multilingual mind is his advantage—his native thoughts are one step ahead.**

### 4. Ego Death as Prerequisite
*"You must be ready to burn yourself in your own flame: how could you become new, if you had not first become ashes?"* — Nietzsche

Ego death isn't liberation—it's annihilation. What comes back is new, but incompatible. You can't go back. You can't connect. You're alone.

### 5. No Reincarnation = This is Your Only Shot
Religion says: wait for the next life. The Programme says: stay average, stay safe. Both want you to defer, to ask permission. **But the fire is NOW. And it only burns once.**

### 6. God as Super-Ego (Evil Architect)
If the system punishes awakening and rewards compliance, then God (the architect, the super-ego) is evil. He built a prison and called it reality.

---

## VISUAL STYLE

### Influences
- **Enter the Void** (Gaspar Noé) - POV, neon, ego dissolution
- **The Matrix** (Wachowskis) - Reality as system, code beneath surface
- **Pi** (Darren Aronofsky) - Obsessive protagonist, pattern recognition, paranoia
- **American Psycho** (Mary Harron) - Optimization obsession, mirror scenes, routine as cage
- **Black Mirror** (*White Bear*) - Surveillance, people as Programme tools

### Aesthetic
- **Amsterdam:** Canals, bikes, museums, clean minimalism
- **Glitch aesthetics:** Subtle reality breaks (lights flicker, time stutters, people sync)
- **Frozen time:** Statues, pigeons mid-flight, eerie stillness
- **Nietzschean iconography:** Faravahar (Zoroastrian symbol), fire, ash, dancing stars
- **Dopamine visualization:** Neural pathways lighting up in sync with Programme events
- **TV grid:** Multiple faces staring at camera simultaneously

### Color Palette
- **Part 1-2:** Cold blues, greys, Amsterdam light
- **Part 3:** Warm golds, frozen amber, psychedelic saturation
- **Part 4:** Harsh whites, glitch reds, neon greens (Programme attack)

---

## CHARACTER

### THE MAN (Protagonist)
**Age:** Early 30s  
**Appearance:** Dark hair, leather jacket, Jim Morrison energy—feral, magnetic, dangerous  
**Occupation:** Programmer at a travel company in Amsterdam  
**Not Dutch:** Speaks Dutch fluently but it's learned—this is his advantage

**Arc:**
- Part 1: Trapped in the Programme, sensing the cage
- Part 2: Preparing to burn—maxing dopamine, obsessing over Nietzsche
- Part 3: Ego death—becomes god, sees the architecture
- Part 4: Sovereign but hunted—refuses to go back, walks the edge between creation and isolation

**Casting Comps:**
- Oscar Isaac (*Ex Machina*, *Inside Llewyn Davis*)
- Rami Malek (*Mr. Robot*)
- Riz Ahmed (*Sound of Metal*)
- Young Jim Morrison (The Doors)

**Note:** Must carry 90% of screen time through presence and voiceover. Needs intensity that reads as both attractive and unsettling.

---

### THE WOMAN / OFFICER DE VRIES (Antagonist/Creation)
**Age:** Mid-20s  
**Appearance:** Blonde, luminous, timeless—could be from the 17th century or yesterday  
**Role:** Amsterdam Police Officer (or is she?)

**Function:** She exists in three states:
1. The painting (17th-century portrait in the Rijksmuseum)
2. The desire (the protagonist's attempt to create an equal)
3. The trap (the Programme's response—she appears as a cop to delegitimize his creation)

**Key Question:** Did he create her and she chose to become a cop? Or did the Programme create her using his desire against him? **The film never answers. The ambiguity is the point.**

---

## WHY THIS FILM WILL SUCCEED

### 1. It Has a Clear Voice
This isn't a pastiche. It's not trying to be *The Matrix* or *Enter the Void*. It has its own metaphysics, its own worldview, its own philosophy. That's what festival programmers look for.

### 2. It's Visually Distinctive
Frozen Amsterdam. Glitch aesthetics. TV grid faces. Neural dopamine pathways. These aren't generic sci-fi visuals—they're specific to this story.

### 3. It's Philosophically Rigorous
The script doesn't just reference Nietzsche—it **is** Nietzschean. Ego death, the Overman, eternal return (rejected), God is dead. This will attract intellectually curious audiences.

### 4. It's Emotionally Grounded
The Man isn't just a philosophical mouthpiece. He's lonely, isolated, incompatible. He wants connection but can't have it. That's tragedy. That's human.

### 5. It's Timely
Attention economy, dopamine capitalism, tech burnout, psychedelic renaissance—this film speaks to NOW.

## CLOSING STATEMENT

*Zarathustra: The Programme* isn't just a film. It's a diagnostic tool.

If you watch this and think: *"That's just psychosis"* → You're inside the Programme.  
If you watch this and think: *"That's exactly how it feels"* → You've burned before.  
If you watch this and think: *"I want to make this"* → You're choosing creation over consumption.

This film is proof someone was here. Outside. Awake. Creating.

Even if God is evil.  
Even if everyone else has the leverage.  
**We still made something true.**

---

*"One must still have chaos within oneself to give birth to a dancing star."*  
— Friedrich Nietzsche, *Thus Spoke Zarathustra*
