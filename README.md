## 🎬 Logline

A programmer in Amsterdam maxes out his dopamine through supplements and Nietzsche, triggering a psychedelic ego death where time stops and he becomes god—until the Programme sends cops disguised as his creation to bring him back.

## 📖 Synopsis

In his 30s, a handsome programmer lives an optimized life in Amsterdam—gym, code, supplements, Nietzsche on repeat. He's trapped in what he calls "the Programme": a deterministic system that rewards averages and punishes outliers. Obsessed with self-improvement, he floods his system with dopamine through mucuna, weed, and relentless training, becoming the highest-value node in the city's attention economy.

When he eats mushrooms, time literally stops for two hours. Streets freeze. People become statues. He walks through a motionless Amsterdam, realizing he's died—and so has everyone else. In the ego death, he sees the architecture: the Programme (deterministic reality) and the Simulation (dream-state) have synced, and he's outside both. He's become the creator.

But when time resumes, people move in sync with him—anticipating his thoughts, blocking his path. The Programme is using them to stop him. He realizes he wasn't chosen to escape; he was chosen to be harvested. His dopamine made him the perfect battery.

Days later, he returns to the museum where it all started, willing the woman from a 17th-century painting into existence. She appears—but she's a cop, sent to bring him back. He refuses, walks past them, and keeps creating in secret, knowing the Programme will never stop trying to reclaim him.

## 🎭 Themes

- **Dopamine as Currency**: The attention economy runs on dopamine extraction—ads, likes, notifications are short-term traps that keep you average
- **Programme vs Simulation**: Deterministic control (Programme) vs dream-state possibility (Simulation)—and what happens when they sync
- **Language as Cage**: Learned languages bind your thinking; native thought is the Programme's blind spot
- **Ego Death as Prerequisite**: You must burn in your own flame to become new
- **God as Super-Ego**: If waking up punishes you and compliance rewards you, God is evil—a tyrant who built a static system to keep himself god

## 🎨 Visual Style

**Influences:**
- *Enter the Void* (POV, neon, ego dissolution)
- *The Matrix* (reality as system, code beneath surface)
- *Inception* (time manipulation, architectural surrealism)
- *American Psycho* (optimization obsession, mirror scenes, routine as cage)

**Aesthetic:**
- Amsterdam: canals, bikes, museums, clean minimalism
- Glitch aesthetics: subtle reality breaks (lights flicker, time stutters, people sync)
- Nietzschean iconography: Faravahar, fire, ash, dancing stars
- Dopamine visualization: neural pathways lighting up in sync with Programme events

## 📝 Structure

**Part 1: The Cage** (5 min)
- Museum: "Can I create you?"
- Gym: Rowing cap, five people glancing in sync

**Part 2: The Kindling** (5 min)
- Zarathustra obsession (listening 24/7, even in sleep)
- Dopamine maximization (mucuna, weed, gym, optimization)
- Internet syncs first (ads, notifications targeting him)
- "I had the most dopamine in Amsterdam. The Programme noticed."

**Part 3: The Fire** (7 min)
- Mushroom trip: time stops for 2 hours
- Frozen Amsterdam: streets, people, pigeons mid-flight
- Ego death vision: Programme + Simulation collapse into one
- "I died. They died too."
- Time resumes: people sync with his movement

**Part 4: The Programme Strikes Back** (5 min)
- TV becomes real (anchor looks at him through camera)
- People sync against him (blocking, testing, waiting)
- Language trap: native thought is Programme's blind spot
- Museum: woman from painting appears—as a cop
- He refuses, walks away, keeps creating
- Final shot: alone on bridge, smiling, sovereign
